        <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
        <p>Lasagna is a hearty baked dish made by layering wide pasta sheets with a rich meat sauce (typically ground beef or sausage simmered with tomatoes, garlic, and herbs), 
            a creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese mixture, and shredded mozzarella or parmesan. The layers are repeated, topped with cheese, and baked until hot, bubbly, and golden on top. 
            It's a comforting, make-ahead-friendly meal perfect for gatherings or family dinners.</p>

            <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>3/4 pound cheese(mozzarella)</li>
            <li>1 Eggs</li>
            <li>3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>16 ounce ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all your Ingredients</li>
            <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned. </li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. </li>
            <li>Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. 
                Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally. </li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. 
                Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. </li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li> 
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. 
                Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. </li>
            <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese. </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. </li>
            <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving. </li>   
        </ol>
