        <p>Mac and cheese is a classic comfort food featuring tender elbow macaroni smothered in a smooth,
            velvety cheese sauce made from a roux of butter and flour 
            mixed with milk and melted cheese—usually sharp cheddar. 
            It can be served creamy straight from the stovetop or baked in the oven with a golden,
            crispy topping of breadcrumbs or extra cheese. Variations may include add-ins like bacon, garlic, 
            or spices for extra flavor. </p>

        <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 8 ounces large elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon spicy brown mustard</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon garlic granules</li>
            <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1 cup half-and-half</li>
            <li>12 ounces shredded aged Gouda cheese </li>
            <li>4 ounces chevre</li>
            <li>1 ½ ounces blue cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup diced corned beef</li>
            <li>½ cup sauerkraut </li>
            <li>¼ cup Thousand Island dressing</li>
            <li>6 slices rye bread</li>

        </ul>

        <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, 
                stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>

            <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
                Whisk flour in gradually until smooth. Cook and whisk continually for 2 minutes. 
                Add mustard, salt, pepper, cayenne, and garlic; stir to combine. Gradually whisk in half-and-half and milk. Cook, whisking continually, 
                until thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. Add 9 ounces Gouda cheese and stir. Add chevre and 1 ounce blue cheese and stir until smooth.
                Remove skillet from heat. Stir cooked macaroni into cheese mixture.</li>
            
            <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>

            <li>Divide macaroni and cheese into 6 greased 6-inch cast iron skillets. Top each with corned beef, sauerkraut, 
                a drizzle of Thousand Island dressing, and equal amounts of remaining Gouda and blue cheeses.</li>

            <li>Broil skillets in the preheated oven until cheese is golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. </li>
            <li>Toast rye bread in a toaster and cut each slice diagonally into points. Serve rye bread with Reuben mac. </li>
        </ol>
