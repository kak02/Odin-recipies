# Odin-recipies

The Recipe Project is part of The Odin Projectâ€™s Foundations curriculum. It involves building a basic website that displays a collection of recipes using only HTML. Through this project, I am demonstrating my understanding of core web development concepts such as creating structured web pages, using semantic HTML elements, organizing project files, and linking between multiple pages. By completing this project, I have gained hands-on experience in writing clean, well-organized HTML and laying the groundwork for more advanced front-end development.
